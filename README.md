### A funny story

At my first day on BeCode before i leave my house, i put on google maps to see the exactly location and do not be lost, then arriving at Charleroi sud, I arrived at the wrong building then I went arround the corner to search and nothing, then I called someone from Becode and the Building was just close to the train station :)
